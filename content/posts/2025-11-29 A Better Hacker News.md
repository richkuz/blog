I've been reading [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com) daily since 2007. I don't use RSS feeds or Twitter, but instead rely on the HN front page to stay in the know on technical news. And since quitting Reddit and mainstream news cold-turkey on November 6, 2024, I also rely on HN to inform me about major world-impacting events (pandemics, global catastrophes, AWS outages) without distractions. But mostly I read HN for fun.

Over the years I've tried various different HN readers and reader apps. None had the sticking power of the main site.

But a week ago I learned about Hckr.News, in particular, its **Small Web filter**.

The **Small Web filter** "Filters for content from the non-commercial, independent web
(personal blogs, hobby sites, etc.) as defined by [Kagi's Small Web initiative](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web).
